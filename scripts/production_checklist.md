## Batch Production Tips

1. **Record in batches**: Film 5-7 videos in one session
2. **Template reuse**: Use consistent intro/outro
3. **Illustration library**: Build reusable components
4. **Code templates**: Prepare boilerplate code
5. **Schedule uploads**: Maintain consistent posting time

## Analytics to Track

- View duration
- Click-through rate
- Engagement (likes, comments)
- Subscriber growth
- Most replayed sections
- Traffic sources

## Improvement Areas

After each batch of 10 videos:
- Review viewer feedback
- Analyze drop-off points
- Update illustration style
- Refine explanation approach
- Optimize video length
