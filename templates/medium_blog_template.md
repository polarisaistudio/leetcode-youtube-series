## üß™ Code Walkthrough

Let's trace through our optimized solution:

```python
# Step-by-step trace with example
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

# Step 1: Initialize
seen = {}

# Step 2: Iterate
i=0, num=2, complement=7
# ... detailed trace
```
```

### 6. Edge Cases & Testing
```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Edge Cases & Testing

**Common edge cases:**
- Empty input
- Single element
- Duplicates
- Negative numbers

**Test cases:**
```python
def test_solution():
    assert solution([2,7,11,15], 9) == [0,1]
    assert solution([3,2,4], 6) == [1,2]
    assert solution([3,3], 6) == [0,1]
```
```

### 7. Interview Tips
```markdown
## üí° Interview Tips

**Communication Strategy:**
1. **Clarify requirements** - Ask about constraints
2. **Start simple** - Implement brute force first
3. **Optimize gradually** - Show your thought process
4. **Test thoroughly** - Walk through examples

**Follow-up Questions to Expect:**
- What if the input was sorted?
- How would you handle very large inputs?
- Can you solve it with O(1) space?

**Red Flags to Avoid:**
- Jumping to complex solution immediately
- Not testing your code
- Ignoring edge cases
```
