# Illustration Guidelines for LeetCode Videos

## Types of Illustrations Needed

### 1. Problem Visualization (illustration_1)
- Input/Output examples
- Visual representation of data structures
- Test case walkthrough
- Size: 1920x1080px
- Format: PNG with transparent background

### 2. Algorithm Flow (illustration_2)
- Step-by-step algorithm visualization
- State changes at each step
- Pointer movements (for two-pointer problems)
- Tree/graph traversals
- Color coding for different elements

### 3. Complexity Visualization (illustration_3)
- Time complexity graphs
- Space complexity diagrams
- Comparison charts between approaches
- Big-O notation visuals

### 4. Code Trace (illustration_4)
- Variable state tracking
- Call stack visualization (for recursion)
- Memory allocation diagrams

## Design Standards

### Color Palette
```
Primary: #4CAF50 (Success/Correct)
Secondary: #2196F3 (Active/Current)
Warning: #FF9800 (Important/Notice)
Error: #F44336 (Wrong/Mistake)
Neutral: #9E9E9E (Inactive)
Background: #1E1E1E (Dark mode friendly)
Text: #FFFFFF (High contrast)
```

### Typography
- Headers: Arial Bold, 48pt
- Subheaders: Arial Regular, 36pt
- Body text: Arial Regular, 24pt
- Code: Courier New, 28pt

### Visual Elements
- Arrays: Rectangular boxes with indices
- Linked Lists: Boxes with arrows
- Trees: Circle nodes with connecting lines
- Graphs: Vertices as circles, edges as lines
- Hash Tables: Key-value pair visualization
- Stacks/Queues: Vertical/Horizontal arrangements

## Illustration Checklist

For each problem, create:
- [ ] Problem example visualization
- [ ] Input/output transformation
- [ ] Algorithm steps (3-5 frames)
- [ ] Complexity comparison chart
- [ ] Edge case demonstrations
- [ ] Final solution summary

## Tools Recommendations
- Draw.io for diagrams
- Excalidraw for hand-drawn style
- Manim for animations
- Python matplotlib for graphs
- CSS animations for web versions
